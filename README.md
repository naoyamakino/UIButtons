This is a sample application that is practicing how to make a custom UIButton reusable in RubyMotion.

REF: http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/33427366406/designing-for-ios-taming-uibutton

what it can do:
- being able to create a customized UIButton using UIImage
- UIImage is resizableImageWithCapInsets, which has a benefit of reusable assets across the app and lighter app bundles.
- exercise the use of helper methods for code-reusablity.
- being able to change a background image on a button based on different state (UIControlStateNormal and UIControlStateHighlighted)
